      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
      <p class="lead">This page answers common questions about Mara Language Preservation (MLP), its purpose, and how the project operates. As the project grows, additional questions and answers will be added based on community feedback.</p>

      <h2>What is Mara Language Preservation (MLP)?</h2>
      <p>Mara Language Preservation (MLP) is a community-led initiative dedicated to documenting, strengthening, and enabling the Mara language for modern use. The project focuses on creating open linguistic resources, digital tools, and documentation that help Mara remain a living and usable language in everyday life, education, and technology.</p>

      <p>MLP is not a commercial organization. It exists to serve the Mara community and anyone interested in learning, researching, or supporting the language.</p>

      <h2>Who runs MLP?</h2>
      <p>MLP is run by volunteers, Mara speakers, and contributors who care about the future of the language. The project values collaboration between community members, educators, linguists, and technologists.</p>

      <p>There is no single authority controlling the language; decisions are guided by community input, cultural respect, and practical needs.</p>

      <h2>Why is Mara language preservation important?</h2>
      <p>Language carries history, identity, knowledge, and worldview. When a language weakens or disappears, much more than words are lost.</p>

      <p>Preserving Mara helps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain cultural continuity</li>
        <li>Support education and literacy</li>
        <li>Enable intergenerational transmission</li>
        <li>Ensure representation in digital and global spaces</li>
      </ul>

      <p>MLP focuses on living preservation, not only archival storage.</p>

      <h2>What kinds of work does MLP do?</h2>
      <p>MLP works across several areas, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mara dictionary and vocabulary documentation</li>
        <li>Grammar and language structure descriptions</li>
        <li>Digital tools (keyboards, fonts, web support)</li>
        <li>Open datasets for research and learning</li>
        <li>Community feedback and collaboration</li>
        <li>Support for localization and digital inclusion</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How can I contribute to MLP?</h2>
      <p>There are many ways to contribute, depending on your interests and skills, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sharing language knowledge or word lists</li>
        <li>Helping with translations or proofreading</li>
        <li>Recording spoken Mara (with consent)</li>
        <li>Providing technical or web development help</li>
        <li>Writing educational or cultural content</li>
        <li>Helping with outreach and awareness</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You do not need to be an expert to contribute. Community participation at all levels is welcome.</p>

      <h2>Do I need to be a linguist or developer to help?</h2>
      <p>No. While technical and linguistic expertise is valuable, MLP also depends on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Native speakers</li>
        <li>Learners</li>
        <li>Teachers</li>
        <li>Writers</li>
        <li>Community members with lived experience</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Your contribution matters even if it is small.</p>

      <h2>Is MLP affiliated with any government or institution?</h2>
      <p>No. MLP is independent and community-run. While it may collaborate with organizations or platforms in the future, it is not controlled by any government, company, or external authority.</p>

      <h2>Will MLP publish data publicly?</h2>
      <p>Where appropriate, MLP publishes open datasets to support learning, research, and digital inclusion. These datasets are shared under clear licenses.</p>

      <p>However:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal or sensitive information is excluded</li>
        <li>Cultural considerations are respected</li>
        <li>Permission is required for sensitive materials</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Not all data is automatically made public.</p>

      <h2>How does MLP handle sensitive or cultural content?</h2>
      <p>MLP follows community guidance and ethical practices. Sensitive materials—such as culturally restricted knowledge or personal data—are handled carefully and are not published without clear consent and discussion.</p>

      <p>Respect for speakers and cultural norms always comes first.</p>

      <h2>Is the Mara language being standardized by MLP?</h2>
      <p>MLP supports responsible standardization where helpful, especially for digital and educational use. This is done carefully and collaboratively, not imposed.</p>

      <p>Standardization is treated as a tool to improve usability—not as a way to erase variation or lived usage.</p>

      <h2>Is MLP trying to replace traditional knowledge?</h2>
      <p>No. MLP exists to support and complement traditional knowledge, not replace it. Elders, speakers, and community traditions are central to the project’s approach.</p>

      <h2>Does MLP collect personal information?</h2>
      <p>MLP collects minimal information, such as optional names or emails when feedback is submitted. This information is used only for communication and project improvement, not for commercial purposes.</p>

      <p>More details are available on the <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> page.</p>

      <h2>Can I use MLP materials for education or research?</h2>
      <p>Yes, in most cases. Many MLP resources are released under open or community-friendly licenses. Please check licensing information and provide attribution where required.</p>

      <h2>Is MLP free to use?</h2>
      <p>Yes. MLP resources are provided free of charge and are intended for public benefit.</p>

      <h2>How is MLP funded?</h2>
      <p>MLP is primarily supported by volunteer effort and community contribution. It does not operate as a commercial service.</p>

      <h2>How can I stay updated about MLP?</h2>
      <p>You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit the website regularly</li>
        <li>Follow project updates where available</li>
        <li>Provide feedback or contact the team</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Future communication channels may be added as the project grows.</p>

      <h2>What are MLP’s long-term goals?</h2>
      <p>MLP aims to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build a stable digital foundation for Mara</li>
        <li>Support education and literacy</li>

        <li>Ensure ethical, community-led stewardship</li>
        <li>Make Mara visible and usable in modern technology</li>
      </ul>
