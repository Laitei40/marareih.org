      <h1>About Mara Language Preservation (MLP)</h1>
      <p class="lead">Mara Language Preservation (MLP) is a grassroots, community-driven initiative dedicated to safeguarding the Mara language and ensuring it remains alive, usable, and relevant in the modern world. The project is led by Mara speakers and volunteers who believe that language is not only a means of communication, but the foundation of identity, culture, and collective memory.</p>

      <p>As technology increasingly shapes how people learn, communicate, and document knowledge, MLP works to ensure that the Mara language is not left behind. Our focus is on practical preservation — helping the language function naturally on phones, computers, and the internet, while remaining faithful to how Mara speakers actually use it.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to document, strengthen, and modernize the Mara language through open, accessible, and community-owned resources.</p>
      <p>We aim to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Document Mara grammar, vocabulary, and usage accurately</li>
        <li>Create open linguistic datasets that anyone can learn from and build upon</li>
        <li>Develop digital tools that support Mara on modern platforms</li>
        <li>Encourage daily use of Mara in education, technology, and online spaces</li>
      </ul>

      <p>By combining linguistic documentation with practical digital solutions, MLP seeks to make Mara a language that can be confidently used both at home and in global digital environments.</p>

      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <h3>Community-Led</h3>
      <p>MLP is guided by Mara speakers and community members. Decisions are made with respect for lived experience, cultural context, and local knowledge.</p>

      <h3>Open and Collaborative</h3>
      <p>We believe language preservation should be open, transparent, and collaborative. Wherever possible, our data, tools, and resources are shared openly to benefit educators, researchers, developers, and the wider community.</p>

      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Language resources should be easy to access and understand. We aim to design tools and documentation that are inclusive, beginner-friendly, and usable across different levels of technical ability.</p>

      <h3>Respect for Speakers</h3>
      <p>The Mara language belongs to its speakers. MLP prioritizes respectful representation, accurate usage, and ethical documentation, ensuring that contributors and communities are treated with dignity.</p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>MLP is an ongoing effort. As the project grows, we hope to expand into education, digital publishing, localization, and community participation — always with the goal of keeping the Mara language strong, visible, and alive for future generations.</p>
